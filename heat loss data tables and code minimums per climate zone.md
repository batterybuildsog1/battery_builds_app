To enhance your window heat loss table for Manual J calculations, incorporate these critical additions based on climate-specific performance, orientation considerations, and advanced glazing technologies:

Standard Double
2	Vinyl	0.30	0.40	0.55	0.30	Zones 1-3 (South)	Basic low-e coating
Northern Double
2	Fiberglass	0.25	0.35	0.50	0.20	Zones 4-8 (North)	Argon fill, 3x low-e coatings
Triple-Pane
3	Wood	0.19	0.26	0.45	0.15	All zones	Krypton gas, passive-house grade
Solar-Optimized
2	Aluminum	0.28	0.18	0.40	0.25	Zones 1-5 (West/East)	Low SHGC for glare/summer heat reduction
Passive Solar
3	Composite	0.21	0.52	0.60	0.18	Zones 4-8 (South-facing)	High SHGC for winter solar gain35
Tinted Glazing
2	Vinyl	0.32	0.22	0.35	0.30	Zones 1-3	Reduces brightness, moderate VT7
Key Additions to Improve Accuracy
Frame Material Adjustments
Include U-value penalties/rewards for conductive frames (e.g., aluminum = +0.05 U-factor vs. vinyl).

Orientation-Specific SHGC

South-facing: Prioritize SHGC >0.40 for passive heating57.

West/East-facing: Use SHGC <0.30 to limit afternoon heat gain7.

Advanced Metrics

VT (Visible Transmittance): Critical for daylighting (aim >0.40 to avoid dark interiors)7.

Condensation Resistance (1-100 scale): Higher values reduce moisture issues in cold climates3.

Gas Fill Options
Add columns for argon (standard) vs. krypton (premium, 15% better U-factor).



Here’s a condensed table of 2021 IECC minimum efficiency requirements for key building components across climate zones, synthesized from code documents and energy.gov guidance15:











2021 IECC Minimum Efficiency Requirements by Climate Zone
Component	Climate Zone 1	Zone 2	Zone 3	Zone 4	Zone 5	Zone 6	Zones 7–8
Ceiling (Uninsulated Attic)
R-30	R-49	R-49	R-60	R-60	R-60	R-60
Wood-Frame Walls
R-13 or R-0 + R-10 CI	R-13 or R-0 + R-10 CI	R-20 or R-13 + R-5 CI	R-20 + R-5 CI	R-20 + R-5 CI	R-20 + R-5 CI	R-20 + R-5 CI
Duct Insulation
R-8 (≥3" ducts)
R-6 (<3" ducts)	Same	Same	Same	Same	Same	Same
Air Sealing
Required for all components (rim joists, windows, ducts, etc.)	5					
Key Notes
Wall Assembly Options:

R-13: Cavity insulation only (e.g., fiberglass batts in 2x4 walls).

R-0 + R-10 CI: Continuous exterior insulation (e.g., rigid foam board).

R-20 + R-5 CI: Hybrid approach (common in Zones 4–8)35.

Ducts:

All ducts in unconditioned spaces require R-8 (large) or R-6 (small).

Windows/Doors:

Not explicitly listed in sources, but 2021 IECC typically mandates:

U-factor ≤ 0.30 (Zones 1–4)

U-factor ≤ 0.27 (Zones 5–8)

SHGC varies by orientation (higher in heating-dominated zones)25.

Air Sealing:

Mandatory for gaps in walls, rim joists, windows, and ducts5.

Example Compliance for This Home
Based on the provided plans:

Walls: 2x6 framing (likely R-19 cavity insulation).

Code Check: For Zone 5, walls require R-20 + R-5 CI or equivalent.

Gap: Existing R-19 batts fall short; add R-5 exterior CI (e.g., 1" rigid foam)35.

Missing Data to Confirm
Local Climate Zone: Verify using the DOE’s Climate Zone Map.

Window Specs: Confirm U-factor/SHGC compliance per IECC Table R402.1.2.
